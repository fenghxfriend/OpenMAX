# Overview
## 1.1  Introduction
This document details the Application Programming nterface (API) for the OpenMAX Integration Layer (IL). Developed as an open standard by The Khronos Group, the IL serves as a low-level interface for audio, video, and imaging codecs used in embedded and/or mobile devices. The principal goal of the IL is to give codecs a degree of system abstraction for the purpose of portability across operating systems and software stacks.
### 1.1.1 About the Khronos Group
The Khronos Group is a member-funded industry consortium focused on the creation of open standard APIs to enable the authoring and playback of dynamic media on a wide variety of platforms and devices. All Khronos members may contribute to the development of Khronos API specifications, may vote at various stages before public
deployment, and may accelerate the delivery of their multimedia platforms and applications through early access to specification drafts and conformance tests. The Khronos Group is responsible for open APIs such as OpenGL ES, OpenML, and OpenVG.
### 1.1.2 A Brief History of OpenMAX
The OpenMAX set of APIs was originally conceived as a method of enabling portability of codecs and media applications throughout the mobile device landscape. Brought into the Khronos Group in mid-2004 by a handful of key mobile hardware companies, OpenMAX has gained the contributions of companies and institutions stretching the breadth of the multimedia field. As such, OpenMAX stands to unify the industry in taking steps toward media codec portability. Stepping beyond mobile platforms, the general nature of the OpenMAX IL API makes it applicable to all media platforms.
##1.2  The OpenMAX Integration Layer
The OpenMAX IL API strives to give media codecs portability across an array of platforms. The interface abstracts the hardware and software architecture in the system. Each codec and relevant transform is encapsulated in a component interface. The OpenMAX IL API allows the user to load, control, connect, and unload the individual components. This flexible core architecture allows the Integration Layer to easily implement almost any media use case and mesh with existing graph-based media frameworks.
###1.2.1 Key Features and Benefits
The OpenMAX IL API gives applications and media frameworks the ability to interface with multimedia codecs and supporting components (i.e., sources and sinks) in a unified manner. The codecs themselves may be any combination of hardware or software and are completely transparent to the user. Without a standardized interface of this nature, codec vendors must write to proprietary or closed interfaces to integrate into mobile devices. In this case, the portability of the codec is minimal at best, costing many development-years of effort in re-tooling these solutions between systems. Thus, the IL incorporates a specialized arsenal of features, honed to combat the problem of portability among many vastly different media systems. Such features include:

- A flexible component-based API core
- Ability to easily plug in new codecs
- Coverage of targeted domains (audio, video, and imaging) while remaining easily extensible by both the Khronos Group and individual vendors
- Capable of being implemented as either static or dynamic libraries
- Retention of key features and configuration options needed by parent software (such as media frameworks)
- Ease of communication between the client and the codecs and between codecs themselves
### 1.2.2 Design Philosophy
As previously stated, the key focus of the OpenMAX IL API is portability of media codecs. The diversity of existing devices and media implementation solutions necessitates that the OpenMAX IL target the higher level of the media software stack as
the key initial user. For most operating systems, this means an existing media framework. Thus, much of the OpenMAX IL API is defined by requirements generated by the needs of media frameworks. Similarly, the IL is designed to allow the media framework layer to be as lightweight as possible. The result is an interface that is easily pluggable into most software stacks across operating system and framework boundaries. Likewise, several features of media frameworks were perceived to be handled at higher levels and not included in the API. Among these is the issue of file handling, which, if desired, may
be easily added to the IL structure outside of the standard. The design of the API also strove to accommodate as many system architectures as possible. The resulting design uses highly asynchronous communications, which allows processing to take place in another thread, on multiple processing elements, or on specialized hardware. In addition, the ability of hardware-accelerated codecs to communicate directly with one another via tunneling affords implementation architectures even greater flexibility and efficiency.
###1.2.3 Software Landscape
In most systems, a user-level media framework already exists. The OpenMAX IL API is designed to easily fit below these frameworks with little to no overhead between the interfaces. In most cases, the media framework provided by the operating system can be replaced with a thin layer that simply translates the API. Figure 1-1 illustrates the software landscape for the OpenMAX IL API.
![](img/1_1.png)

**Figure 1-1. OpenMAX IL API Software Landscape**

To remove possible reader confusion, the OpenMAX standard also defines a set of
Development Layer (DL) primitives on which codecs can be built. The DL primitives
and their full relationship to the IL are specified in other OpenMAX specification
documents.
###1.2.4 Stakeholders
A few categories of stakeholders represent the broad array of companies participating in
the production of multimedia solutions, each with their own interest in the IL API.
####1.2.4.1  Silicon Vendors
Silicon vendors (SV) are responsible for delivering a representative set of OpenMAX IL
components that are specific to the vendor’s platform. The vendors are anticipated to
also supply components that are representative of the capabilities of their platforms.
####1.2.4.2  Independent Software Vendors
Independent software vendors (ISV) are anticipated to deliver additional differentiated
OpenMAX IL components that may or may not be specific to a given silicon vendor’s
platform.
####1.2.4.3  Operating System Vendors
Operating System Vendors (OSV) are anticipated to deliver software multimedia
framework and standard reference OpenMAX IL components that enable integration of
the representative silicon vendor’s components and ISV components. The OSV is
responsible for conformance testing of the standard reference OpenMAX components.
####1.2.4.4  Original Equipment Manufacturers
Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) are anticipated to modify and optimize the
integration of OpenMAX components provided by SVs, ISVs, and OSVs to their specific
product architectures to enable delivery of OpenMAX integrated multimedia devices.
OEMs may also develop and integrate their own proprietary OpenMAX components.
###1.2.5 The Interface
The OpenMAX IL API is a component-based media API that consists of two main
segments: the core API and the component API.
####1.2.5.1  Core
The OpenMAX IL core is used for dynamically loading and unloading components and
for facilitating component communication. Once loaded, the API allows the user to
communicate directly with the component, which eliminates any overhead for high
commands. Similarly, the core allows a user to establish a communication tunnel
between two components. Once established, the core API is no longer used and
communications flow directly between components.
####1.2.5.2  Components
In the OpenMAX Integration Layer, components represent individual blocks of
functionality. Components can be sources, sinks, codecs, filters, splitters, mixers, or any
other data operator. Depending on the implementation, a component could possibly
represent a piece of hardware, a software codec, another processor, or a combination
thereof.
The individual parameters of a component can be set or retrieved through a set of
associated data structures, enumerations, and interfaces. The parameters include data
relevant to the component’s operation (i.e., codec options) or the actual execution state of
the component.
Buffer status, errors, and other time-sensitive data are relayed to the application via a set
of callback functions. These are set via the normal parameter facilities and allow the API
to expose more of the asynchronous nature of system architectures.
Data communication to and from a component is conducted through interfaces called
ports. Ports represent both the connection for components to the data stream and the
buffers needed to maintain the connection. Users may send data to components through
input ports or receive data through output ports. Similarly, a communication tunnel
between two components can be established by connecting the output port of one
component to a similarly formatted input port of another component.
##1.3  Definitions
When this specification discusses requirements and features of the OpenMAX IL API,
specific words are used to convey their necessity in an implementation. Table 1-1 shows
a list of these words.



| Word | Definition |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| May  | The stated functionality is an optional requirement for an implementation of the OpenMAX IL API. Optional features are not required by the specification but may have conformance requirements if they are implemented. This is an optional feature as in “The component may have vendor specific extensions.” |
| Shall | The stated functionality is a requirement for an implementation of the OpenMAX IL API. If a component fails to meet a shall statement, it is not considered to conform to this specification. Shall is always used as a requirement, as in “The component designers shall produce good documentation.” |
| Should | The stated functionality is not a requirement for an implementation of the OpenMAX IL API but is recommended or is a good practice. Should is usually used as follows: “The component should begin processing buffers immediately after it transitions to the OMX_StateExecuting state.” While this is good practice, there may be a valid reason to delay processing buffers, such as not having input data available. |
| Will | The stated functionality is not a requirement for an implementation of the OpenMAX IL API. Will is usually used when referring to a third party, as in “the application framework will correctly handle errors.” |

#2 OpenMAX IL Introduction and Architecture
This section of the document describes the OpenMAX IL features and architecture.
##2.1  OpenMAX IL Description
The OpenMAX IL layer is an API that defines a software interface used to provide an
access layer around software components in a system. The intent of the software
interface is to take components with disparate initialization and command methodologies
and provide a software layer that has a standardized command set and a standardized
methodology for construction and destruction of the components.
###2.1.1 Architectural Overview
Consider a system that requires the implementation of four multimedia processing
functions denoted as F1, F2, F3, and F4. Each of these functions may be from different
vendors or may be developed in house but by different groups within the organization.
Each may have different requirements for setup and teardown. Each may have different
methods of facilitating configuration and data transfer. The OpenMAX IL API provides
a means of encapsulating these functions, singly or in logical groups, into components.
The API includes a standard protocol that enables compliant components that are
potentially from different vendors/groups to exchange data with one another and be used
interchangeably.

The OpenMAX IL API interfaces with a higher-level entity denoted as the IL client,
which is typically a functional piece of a filter graph multimedia framework or an
application. The IL client interacts with a centralized IL entity called the core. The IL
client uses the OpenMAX core for loading and unloading components, setting up direct
communication between two OpenMAX components, and accessing the component’s
method functions.

An IL client always communicates with a component via the IL core. In most cases, this
communication equates to calling one of the IL core’s macros, which translates directly
to a call on one of the component methods. Exceptions (where the IL client calls an
actual core function that works) include component creation and destruction and
connection via tunneling of two components.

Components embody the media processing function or functions. Although this
specification clearly defines the functionality of the OpenMAX core, the component
provider defines the functionality of a given component. Components operate on four
types of data that are defined according to the parameter structures that they export: audio,
video, image, and other (e.g., time data for synchronization).

An OpenMAX component provides access to a standard set of component functions via
its component handle. These functions allow a client to get and set component and port
configuration parameters, get and set the state of the component, send commands to the
component, receive event notifications, allocate buffers, establish communications with a
single component port, and establish communication between two component ports.
Every OpenMAX component shall have at least one port to claim OpenMAX
conformance. Although a vendor may provide an OpenMAX-compatible component without ports, the bulk of conformance testing is dependent on at least one conformant
port. The four types of ports defined in OpenMAX correspond to the types of data a port
may transfer: audio, video, and image data ports, and other ports. Each port is defined as
either an input or output depending on whether it consumes or produces buffers.
In a system containing four multimedia processing functions F1, F2, F3, and F4, a system
implementer might provide a standard OpenMAX interface for each of the functions. The
implementer might just as easily choose any combination of functions. The delineation
for the separation of this functionality is based on ports. Figure 2-1 shows a few possible
partitions for an OpenMAX implementation that provides these functions.

**Table 2-2. Key Definitions**
###2.1.3 System Components
Figure 2-2 depicts the various types of communication enabled with OpenMAX. Each
component can have an arbitrary number of ports for data communication. Components
with a single output port are referred to as source components. Components with a single
input port are referred to as sink components. Components running entirely on the host
processor are referred to as host components. Components running on a loosely coupled
accelerator are referred to as accelerator components. OpenMAX may be integrated
directly with an application or may be integrated with multimedia framework
components enabling heterogeneous implementations.

Three types of communication are described. Non-tunneled communications defines a
mechanism for exchanging data buffers between the IL client and a component.
Tunneling defines a standard mechanism for components to exchange data buffers
directly with each other in a standard way. Proprietary communication describes a
proprietary mechanism for direct data communications between two components and
may be used as an alternative when a tunneling request is made, provided both
components are capable of doing so.
![](img/2_2.png)


**Figure 2-2. OpenMAX IL API System Components**
####2.1.3.1  Component Profiles
OpenMAX component functionality is grouped into two profiles: base profile and interop
profile.

The base profile shall support non-tunneled communication. Base profile components
may support proprietary communication. Base profile components do not support
tunneled communication.

The interop profile is a superset of the base profile. An interop profile component shall
support non-tunneled communication and tunneled communication. An interop profile
component may support proprietary communication.

The primary difference between the interop profile and the base profile is that the
component supports tunneled communication. The base profile exists to reduce the
adoption barrier for OpenMAX implementers by simplifying the implementation. A base
profile component does not need to implement tunneled communication.
###2.1.4 Component States
Each OpenMAX component can undergo a series of state transitions, as depicted in
Figure 2-3. Every component is first considered to be unloaded. The component shall be
loaded through a call to the OpenMAX core. All other state transitions may then be
achieved by communicating directly with the component.

A component can enter an invalid state when a state transition is made with invalid data.
For example, if the callback pointers are not set to valid locations, the component may
time out and alert the IL client of the error. The IL client shall stop, de-initialize, unload,
and reload the component when the IL client detects an invalid state. Figure 2-3 depicts
the invalid state as enterable from any state, although the only way to exit the invalid
state is to unload and reload the component.

![](img/2_3.png)

**Figure 2-3. Component States**

Transitioning into the IDLE state may fail since this state requires allocation of all
operational resources. When the transition from LOADED to IDLE fails, the IL client
may try again or may choose to put the component into the WAIT FOR RESOURCES
state. Upon entering the WAIT FOR RESOURCE state, the component registers with a
vendor-specific resource manager to alert it when resources have become available. The
resource manager subsequently puts the component into the IDLE state. A command that
the IL client sends controls all other state transitions except to INVALID.

The IDLE state indicates that the component has all of its needed resources but is not
processing data. The EXECUTING state indicates that the component is pending
reception of buffers to process data and will make required callbacks as specified in
section 3. The PAUSED state maintains a context of buffer execution with the component
without processing data or exchanging buffers. Transitioning from PAUSED to
EXECUTING enables buffer processing to resume where the component left off.

Transitioning from EXECUTING or PAUSED to IDLE will cause the context in which
buffers were processed to be lost, which requires the start of a stream to be reintroduced.
Transitioning from IDLE to LOADED will cause operational resources such as
communication buffers to be lost.
###2.1.5 Component Architecture
Figure 2-4 depicts the component architecture. Note that there is only one entry point for
the component (through its handle to an array of standard functions) but there are
multiple possible outgoing calls that depend on how many ports the component has. Each
component will make calls to a specified IL client event handler. Each port will also
make calls (or callbacks) to a specified external function. A queue for pointers to buffer
headers is also associated with each port. These buffer headers point to the actual buffers.
The command function also has a queue for commands. All parameter or configuration
calls are performed on a particular index and include a structure associated with that
parameter or configuration, as depicted in Figure 2-4.

![](img/2_4.png)

**Figure 2-4. OpenMAX IL API Component Architecture**

A port must support callbacks to the IL client and, when part of an interop profile
component, must support communication with ports on other components.
###2.1.6 Communication Behavior
Configuration of a component may be accomplished once the handle to the component
has been received from the OpenMAX core. Data communication calls with a component
are non-blocking and are enabled once the number of ports has been configured, each
port has been configured for a specific data format, and the component has been put in
the appropriate state. Data communication is specific to a port of the component. Input ports are always called from the IL client with OMX_EmptyThisBuffer (for more
information, see section 3.2.2.17). Output ports are always called from the IL client with
OMX_FillThisBuffer (for more information, see section 3.2.2.18). In an in-context
implementation, callbacks to OMX_EmptyBufferDone or OMX_FillBufferDone
will be made before the return. Figure 2-5 depicts the anticipated behavior for an in-
context versus an out-of-context implementation. Note that the IL client should not make
assumptions about return/callback sequences to enable heterogeneous integration of in-
context and out-of-context OpenMAX components.

![](img/2_5.png)

**Figure 2-5. Out-of-Context versus In-Context Operation**

Data communications with components is always directed to a specific component port.
Each port has a component-defined minimum number of buffers it shall allocate or use. A
port associates a buffer header with each buffer. A buffer header references data in the
buffer and provides metadata associated with the contents of the buffer. Every component
port shall be capable of allocating its own buffers or using pre-allocated buffers; one of
these choices will usually be more efficient than the other.
###2.1.7 Tunneled Buffer Allocation and Sharing
This section describes buffer allocation for tunneling components and buffer sharing. For
a given tunnel, exactly one port supplies the buffers and passes those buffers to the non-
supplier port. In the simplest case, the supplier also allocates the buffers. Under the right
circumstances, however, a tunneling component may choose to re-use buffers from one
port on another to avoid memory copies and optimize memory usage. This practice is
known as buffer sharing.

A tunnel between any two ports represents a dependency between those ports. Buffer
sharing extends that dependency so that all ports that share the same set of buffers form an implicit dependency chain. Exactly one port in that dependency chain allocates the
buffers shared by all of them.

Buffer sharing is implemented within a component and is transparent to other
components. The non-supplier port is unaware whether the supplier’s component
allocated the buffers itself or re-used buffers from another of its ports. Furthermore, the
supplier is unaware of whether the non-supplier’s component will re-use the buffers that
the supplier provided.

Strictly speaking, a component is only obligated to obey the external semantics required
of it and may implement buffer sharing behind those semantics. More specifically,
external semantics require that a component do the following:

-  Provide buffers on all of its supplier ports.
-  Accurately communicate buffer requirements on its ports.
-  Pass a buffer from an output port to an input port with an OMX_EmptyThisBuffer call.
-  Return a buffer from an input port to an output port with an OMX_FillThisBuffer call.

If a component chooses to share buffers, its implementation may fulfill those
requirements by doing the following:

-  Provide re-used buffers on some supplier ports.
-  Account for the needs of shared ports when communicating buffer requirements on ports.
-  Internally pass a buffer from an input port to an output port between an OMX_EmptyThisBuffer call and its corresponding OMX_EmptyBufferDone call.
  
OpenMAX defines external component semantics to be compatible with sharing,
although it does not explicitly require that a component support sharing. This section
discusses the implementation of those semantics in the context of buffer sharing. If no
components are sharing buffers, the implementation reduces to a simpler set of steps and
obligations.
####2.1.7.1  Relevant Terms
This section describes terms used in discussions of tunneled buffer allocation and sharing.
Figure 2-6 illustrates the concepts.
![](img/2_6.png)

**Figure 2-6. Example of Buffer Allocation and Sharing Relationships**

Among a pair of ports that are tunneling, the port that calls UseBuffer on its neighbor is
known as a supplier port. A buffer supplier port does not necessarily allocate its buffers;
it may re-use buffer from another port on the same component. Ports a and c in Figure 2-
6 illustrate supplier ports.

The port that receives the UseBuffer calls from its neighbor is known as a non-supplier
port. Ports b and d Figure 2-6 illustrate non-supplier ports.

A port’s tunneling port is the port neighboring it with which it shares a tunnel. For
example, port b in Figure 2-6 is the tunneling port to port a. Likewise, port a is the
tunneling port to port b.

An allocator port is a supplier port that also allocates its own buffers. Port a in Figure 2-6
is the only allocator port.

A sharing port is a port that re-uses buffers from another port on the same component.
For example, port c in Figure 2-6 is a sharing port.

A tunneling component is a component that uses at least one tunnel.

The set of buffer requirements for a port includes the number of buffers required and the
required size of each buffer. The maximum of multiple sets of buffer requirements is
defined as the largest number of buffers mandated in any set combined with the largest
size mandated in any set. One port retrieves buffer requirements from its tunneled port in
a OMX_PORTDEFINITIONTYPE structure via an OMX_GetParameter call on the
tunneled port's component. Note that one port may determine buffer requirements from a
port that shares its buffers without resorting to an OMX_GetParameter call since they
are both contained in the same component.
####2.1.7.2  IL Client Component Setup
To set up tunneling components, the IL client shall perform the following setup
operations in this order:

1. Load all tunneling components and set up the tunnels on these components.
2. Command all tunneling components to transition from the loaded state to the idle
state.

If the IL client does not operate in this manner, a tunneling component might never
transition to idle because of the possible dependencies between components.

####2.1.7.3  Component Transition from Loaded to Idle State with Sharing
During the OMX_SetupTunnel call, the two ports of a tunnel establish which port
(input or output) will act as the buffer supplier. Thus, when a component is commanded
to transition from loaded to idle, it is aware of the roles of all its supplier or non-supplier
ports.

When commanded to transition from loaded to idle, a component performs the following
operations in this order:

1. The component determines what buffering sharing it will implement, if any. The
following rules apply:
	- a) A component may re-use a buffer only from one of its one input ports on one or more of its output ports or from one of its output ports on one of its input ports.
	- b) Only a supplier port may re-use the buffers from another port.
	- c) A component sharing buffers over multiple output ports requires read-only output port as shown in Figure 2-7.
![](img/2_7.png)

**Figure 2-7. Possible Sharing Relationships**

2. The component determines which of its supplier ports, if any, are also allocator ports.
A supplier port is also an allocator port only if it does not re-use buffers from a non-
supplier port on the same component (i.e., is not a sharing port). In Figure 2-8, a
supplier port is a port with an arrow pointing away. A non-supplier port is a port with
an arrow pointing toward it. An arrow from one port represents a sharing relationship.
A port with boxes (buffers) adjacent to it represents an allocator port.

![](img/2_8.png)

**Figure 2-8. Determining Allocators**

3. The component allocates its buffers for each of its allocator ports as follows:
	- a) For each port that re-uses the allocator ports buffer, the allocator port determines the buffer requirements of the sharing port. See obligation A below.
	- b) The allocator port determines the buffer requirements of its tunneled port via an OMX_GetParameter call. See obligation B below.
	- c) The allocator port allocates buffers according to the maximum of its own requirements, the requirements of the tunneled port, and the requirement of all of the sharing ports.
	- d) The allocator port informs the non-supplier port that it is tunneling with of the actual number of buffers via an OMX_SetParameter call on OMX_IndexParamPortDefinition by setting the value of nBufferCountActual appropriately. See obligation E below.
	- e) The allocator port shares its buffers with each sharing port that re-uses its buffers. See obligation D below.
	- f) For every allocated buffer, the allocator port calls OMX_UseBuffer on its tunneling port. See obligation C below.
	

A component shall also fulfill the following obligations:

- A. For a sharing port to determine its requirements, the sharing port shall first call OMX_GetParameter on its tunneled port to query for requirements and then return the maximum of its own requirements and the requirements of the tunneled ports.
- B.  When a non-supplier port receives an OMX_GetParameter call querying its buffer requirements, the non-supplier port shall first determine the requirements of all ports that re-use its buffers (see obligation A) and then return the maximum of its own requirements and those of its ports.
- C.  When a non-supplier port receives an OMX_UseBuffer call from its tunneled port, the non-supplier port shall share the buffer with all ports on that component that re-use it.
- D.  When a port A shares a buffer with a port B on the same component where port B re-uses the buffer of port A, then port B shall call OMX_UseBuffer and pass the buffer on its tunneled port.
- E.  When a non-supplier port receives a OMX_SetParameter call on
OMX_IndexParamPortDefinition from its tunneled port, the non-supplier
port shall pass the nBufferCountActual field to any port that re-uses its buffers.
Likewise, each supplier port that receives the nBufferCountActual field in this
way shall pass the nBufferCount to its tunneled port by performing an
OMX_SetParameter call on OMX_IndexParamPortDefinition. The actual
number of buffers used throughout the dependency chain is propagated in this way.

A component may transition from loaded to idle when all enabled ports have all the
buffers they require.

In practice, there could be a direct mapping between the following:

-  Steps 1-3 discussed earlier and code in the loaded-to-idle case in the state transition handler
-  Obligation A and a subroutine to determine a shared ports buffer requirements
-  Obligation B and the OMX_GetParameter implementation
-  Obligation C and the OMX_UseBuffer implementation
-  Obligation D and a subroutine to share a buffer from one port to another
  
To clarify why conformity to these steps and obligations leads to proper buffer allocation,
consider the example illustrated in Figure 2-9. Note that this example is contrived to
exercise every step and obligation outlined above, and is therefore more complex then
most real use cases.

![](img/2_9.png)

**Figure 2-9. Example of Buffer Allocation**
This discussion focuses only on the transition of component 3 to idle; similar operations
occur inside the other components.

When the IL client commands component 3 to transition from loaded to idle, it follows
the following prescribed steps:

1. Component 3 notices that it can re-use port d’s buffers since port e is a supplier port. Component 3 establishes a sharing relationship from port d to port e.
2. Component 3 decides that since port d is a supplier port that does not re-use buffers,
port d shall be an allocator port.
3. Component 3 allocates and distributes port d’s buffers:
	- a) Since port e will re-use the buffer of port d, component 3 determines the buffer requirements of port e. In accordance with obligation A, port e calls OMX_GetParameter on port f to determine its buffer requirements and reports the requirements as the maximum between its own and those of port f.
	- b) Port d calls OMX_GetParameter on port c to determine its buffer requirements. In accordance with obligation B, port c shall determine the buffer requirements of port b. In accordance with obligation A, port b returns the maximum of its own requirements and the requirement of port a (retrieved via OMX_GetParameter) when queried. Port c then returns the maximum of its own requirements and the requirements that port b returns.
	- c) Port d allocates buffers according to the maximum of its own requirements and the requirements that ports c and e return. The resulting buffers are effectively allocated according to the maximum requirements of ports a, b, c, d, e, and f, all of which use the buffers of port d.
	- d) Since port e will re-use the buffers of port d, component 3 shares these buffers with port e. In accordance with obligation D, port e calls OMX_UseBuffer on port f for every buffer that is shared.
	- e) For each buffer allocated, port d calls OMX_UseBuffer on port c. In accordance with obligation C, port c shares each buffer with port b. Port b, in turn, obeys obligation D and calls OMX_UseBuffer on port a with the buffer.

Since all ports of all components now have their buffers, all components may transition
to idle.
####2.1.7.4  Protocol for Using a Shared Buffer
When an input port receives a shared buffer via an OMX_EmptyThisBuffer call, the
input port may re-use that buffer on an output port that it is sharing with the output port
by obeying the following rules:

- The output port calls OMX_EmptyThisBuffer on its tunneling port before the input port sends the corresponding OMX_EmptyBufferDone call to its tunneling port.
- The input port does not call OMX_EmptyBufferDone until all output ports on which the buffer is shared (i.e., via OMX_EmptyThisBuffer calls) return OMX_EmptyBufferDone.
####2.1.7.5  Component Transition from Loaded to Idle State without Sharing
If a component does not share buffers, the component implementation reduces to a
simpler set of steps and obligations than the case for sharing buffers.

When commanded to transition from loaded to idle, a non-sharing component performs
the following operations in this order:

1. The component determines what buffering sharing it will implement, if any. In this case, there is no sharing.
2. The component determines which of its supplier ports, if any, are also allocator ports. All supplier ports are allocator ports.
3. The component allocates it buffers for each allocator port as follows:
	- a. Since there is no sharing, the component does not ask the sharing port for requirements.
	- b. The allocator determines the buffer requirements of its tunneled port via an OMX_GetParameter call.
	- c. The allocator allocates buffers according to the maximum of its own requirements and the requirements of the tunneled ports.
	- d. Since there is no sharing, no buffers must be passed to sharing ports.
	- e. For every allocated buffer, the allocator port calls OMX_UseBuffer on its tunneling port.
	
All component obligations described for sharing components do not apply to non-sharing components.

###2.1.8 Port Reconnection
Port reconnection enables a tunneled component to be replaced with another tunneled
component without having to tear down surrounding components. In Figure 2-10,
component B1 is to be replaced with component B2. To do this, the component A output
port and the component B input port shall first be disabled with the port disable command.
Once all allocated buffers have returned to their rightful owner and freed, the component
A output port may be connected to component B2. The component B1 output port and the
component C input port should similarly be given the port disable command. After all
allocated buffers have returned to their owners and freed, the component C input port
may be connected to the component B2 output port. Then all ports may be given the
enable command.

![](img/2_10.png)

**Figure 2-10. Port Reconnection**

In some cases such as audio, reconnecting one component to another and then fading in
data for one component while fading out data for the original component may be
desirable. Figure 2-11 illustrates how this would work. In step 1, component A sends data
to component B1, which then sends the data on to component C. Components A and C
both have an extra port that is disabled. In step 2, the IL client first establishes a tunnel
between component A and B2, then establishes a tunnel between B2 and C, and then
enables all ports in the two tunnels. Component C may be able to mix data from
components B1 and B2 at various gains, assuming that these are audio components. In
step 3, the ports connected to component B1 from components A and C are disabled, and
component B1 resources may be de-allocated.

![](img/2_11.png)

**Figure 2-11. Reconnecting Components**

###2.1.9 Queues and Flush
A separate command queue enables the component to flush buffers that have not been
processed and return these buffers to the IL client when using non-tunneled
communication, or to the tunneled port when using tunneled communication. In Figure 2-
12, assume that the component has an output port that is using buffers allocated by the IL
client. In this example, the client sends a series of five buffers to the component before
sending the flush command. Upon processing the flush command, the component returns
each unprocessed buffer in the original order, and finally triggers its event handler to
notify the IL client. Two buffers were already processed before the flush command got
processed. The component returns the remaining three buffers unfilled and generates an
event. The IL client should wait for the event before attempting to de-initialize the
component.

![](img/2_12.png)

**Figure 2-12. Flushing Buffers**

###2.1.10  Marking Buffers
An IL client can also trigger an event to be generated when a marked buffer is
encountered. A buffer can be marked in its buffer header. The mark is internally
transmitted from an input buffer to an output buffer in a chain of OpenMAX components.
The mark enables a component to send an event to the IL client when the marked buffer
is encountered. Figure 2-13 depicts how this works.

![](img/2_13.png)

**Figure 2-13. Marking Buffers**
The IL client sends a command to mark a buffer. The next buffer sent from the output
port of the component is marked B1. Component B processes the B1 buffer and provides
the results in buffer B2 along with the mark. When component C receives the marked
buffer B2 through its input port, the component does not trigger its event handler until it
has processed the buffer.
###2.1.11  Events and Callbacks
Six kinds of events are sent by a component to the IL client:

- Error events are enumerated and can occur at any time
- Command complete notification events are triggered upon successful execution of a command.
- Marked buffer events are triggered upon detection of a marked buffer by a component.
- A port settings changed notification event is generated when the component changes its port settings.
- A buffer flag event is triggered when an end of stream is encountered.
- A resources acquired event is generated when a component gets resources that it has been waiting for.

Ports make buffer handling callbacks upon availability of a buffer or to indicate that a
buffer is needed.

###2.1.12  Buffer Payload
The port configuration is used to determine and define the format of the data to be
transferred on a component port, but the configuration does not define how that data
exists in the buffer.

There are generally three cases that describe how a buffer can be filled with data. Each
case presents its own benefits.

In all cases, the range and location of valid data in a buffer is defined by the pBuffer,
nOffset, and nFilledLength parameters of the buffer header. The pBuffer
parameter points to the start of valid data in the buffer. The nOffset parameter
indicates the number of bytes between the start of the buffer and the start of valid data.
The nFilledLength parameter specifies the number of contiguous bytes of valid data
in the buffer. The valid data in the buffer is therefore located in the range pBuffer +
nOffset to pBuffer + nOffset + nFilledLength.

The following cases are representative of compressed data in a buffer that is transferred
into or out of a component when decoding or encoding. In all cases, the buffer just
provides a transport mechanism for the data with no particular requirement on the content.
The requirement for the content is defined by the port configuration parameters.

The shaded portion of the buffer represents data and the white portion denotes no data.

Case 1: Each buffer is filled in whole or in part. In the case of buffers containing
compressed data frames, the frames are denoted by f1 to fn.

![](img/2_13_1.png)

Case 1 provides a benefit when decoding for playback. The buffer can accommodate
multiple frames and reduce the number of transactions required to buffer an amount of
data for decoding. However, this case may require the decoder to parse the data when
decoding the frames. It also may require the decoder component to have a frame-building
buffer in which to put the parsed data or maintain partial frames that would be completed
with the next buffer.

Case 2: Each buffer is filled with only complete frames of compressed data.

![](img/2_13_2.png)

Case 2 differs from case 1 because it requires the compressed data to be parsed first so
that only complete frames are put in the buffers. Case 2 may also require the decoder
component to parse the data for decoding. This case may not require the extra working
buffer for parsing frames required in case 1.
Case 3: Each buffer is filled with only one frame of compressed data.

![](img/2_13_3.png)

The benefit in case 3 is that a decoding component does not have to parse the data.
Parsing would be required at the source component. However, this method creates a
bottleneck in data transfer. Data transfer would be limited to one frame per transfer.
Depending on the implementation, one transaction per frame could have a greater impact
on performance than parsing frames from a buffer.

At a minimum, a decoder or encoder component would be required to support case 1. By
definition, if a codec component can support case 1, then it can support cases 2 and 3, but
only if the compression format allows for byte-aligned frame boundaries. Operating in
case 2 or 3 may not make sense when, for example, configuring an Adaptive Multi-Rate
(AMR) codec for RTP-payload format, bandwidth-efficient mode. The non-byte aligned
frames defined by this format would not fit the byte-aligned frame boundaries defined by
these cases.

When filling a buffer with compressed data for input to a decoder or output from an
encoder, a problem with limiting the filling to complete frames only might arise when frames are not byte aligned. Padding would have to be added outside of any padding
defined in the format specification. The padding would then need to be removed, since
the data could not be appended as is. This would require knowledge of the padding bits
outside of any standard specification. Likewise, if this padding were not in place to
maintain compliance with the standards specification for the port configuration, complete
frames could not always be placed in the buffers. In either case, specific knowledge of
how this situation is handled would be required, and may be different between
components.

For interoperability, the content delivered in a buffer should not be assumed or required
to be any number of complete frames, although at least one complete unit of data will be
delivered in a buffer for uncompressed data formats. Compressed data formats do not
place restrictions on the amount of content delivered in each buffer.
###2.1.13  Buffer Flags and Timestamps
Buffer flags associate certain properties (e.g., the end of a data stream) with the data
contained in a buffer. A buffer timestamp associates a presentation time in microseconds
with the data in the buffer used to time the rendering of that data. Once a timestamp is
associated with a buffer, no component should alter the timestamp for rate control or
synchronization, which are implemented in the clock component.

Buffer metadata (i.e., flags and timestamps) applies to the first new logical unit in the
buffer. Thus, given the presence of multiple logical units in a buffer, the metadata applies
to the logical unit whose starting boundary occurs in the buffer. Unless otherwise stated
(e.g., in a flag definition), a component that receives a logical input unit marked with a
flag or timestamp shall copy that metadata to all logical output units that the input
contributes to.
###2.1.14  Synchronization
Synchronization is enabled by the use of synchronization (sync) ports on a clock
component. These ports and the clock component are defined within the “other” domain
and operate with the same protocols and calls that regulate data ports. The clock
component maintains a media clock that tracks the position in the media stream based on
audio and video reference clocks. The clock component transmits buffers containing time
information (denoted by a media time update and containing the media clock’s current
position, scale, and state) to client components via sync ports. A client component may
time the execution of an operation (e.g., the presentation of a video frame) to a timestamp
by requesting that the clock component send that timestamp when it matches the media
clock. In this case, the client component executes the operation when it receives the
fulfillment of the request over its sync port. Figure 2-14 illustrates the flow of time and
data buffers in an example configuration of components.

![](img/2_14.png)


**Figure 2-14. Flow of Time and Data Buffers**
###2.1.15  Rate Control
The clock component also implements all rate control by exposing a set of configurations
for controlling its media clock. The IL client may change the scale factor of the media
clock (effectively changing the rate and direction that the media clock advances) to
implement play, fast forward, rewind, pause, and slow motion trick modes. The IL client
may also start and stop the clock by using these configurations to change the state of the
media clock. The clock component makes all of its client components aware of a change
to the media clock scale and state by sending a media time update with the new scale or
state on all sync ports. Although a component may not alter a buffer timestamp in
reaction to a scale change, a component may alter its processing accordingly. For
instance, an audio component might scale and pitch correct audio during trick modes or
cease transmitting output entirely.
###2.1.16  Component Registration
How components are registered with a core is generally core specific.

However, if the core supports static linking with components, then it will support a
standard compile-time component registration scheme as described in section 3. Vendors
can therefore supply components that are suitable for static linking with all cores that
support it; this is achieved by placing component information into a data structure that is
linked with the component and the core.

A component can be registered statically using this mechanism but have the bulk of its
code dynamically loaded.
###2.1.17  Resource Management
This section discusses the role of resource management in the OpenMAX IL API.
####2.1.17.1  Need for Resource Management
When a component is not allowed to go to idle state due to lack of resources, the IL client
has cannot know what the limited resource is or which components are using that
resource. Therefore, the IL client cannot, for example, free up resources for a mandatory
audio stream to play without turning off all of the IL components or having specific knowledge of IL component implementations, neither of which is a viable option. These
situations necessitate IL resource management.

One of the goals of OpenMAX is hardware independence provided by the IL layer to the layers above it. The goal of hardware independence can be achieved by specifying the following requirements regarding resource management:

- An IL client (e.g., a multimedia plug-in that is typically part of a software platform) should not need to know the details of an IL implementation or which resource an IL component is using. For example, the IL client might have no information on whether a component is hardware accelerated or not.
- In case of resource conflicts, an IL client should be able to rely on consistent component behavior across IL implementations and hardware platforms.
-  An IL client should not have to interface directly with a hardware vendor-specific resource manager for two reasons.
	-  This method violates the goal of hardware independence.
	-  This method adds considerable re-work to the IL client, which has an impact on the re-usability of the IL client on multiple hardware platforms.
	  
Although resource management is not fully addressed in OpenMAX IL API version 1.0,
“hooks” for resource management have been put in place in the form of behavioral rules,
component priorities, and a resource management-related component state. These
“hooks” lay the groundwork for full-fledged resource management in later versions of the
OpenMAX IL API.

Before proceeding further, the terms resource management and policy are defined for the
benefit of the discussion that follows:

-  Resource management is responsible for managing the access of components to a
limited resource. A resource manager will be aware of how much of a specific
resource is available, which components are currently using the resource, and how
much of the resource the components are using. A resource manager will recommend
to policy which components should be pre-empted or resumed based on resource
conflicts and availability.
-  Policy is responsible for managing component chains or streams. The policy manager
determines if a stream is allowed to run or resume based on information it receives
from resource management, system configuration, requests from applications, or
other factors.
####2.1.17.2  Architectural Assumptions
The following discussion makes two architectural assumptions about the OpenMAX IL:

-  Assumption 1: A framework exists that contains a policy manager between the
applications and the OpenMAX IL.
-  Assumption 2: A system can have one or more hardware platforms that are used by
different OpenMAX components and that are managed by hardware vendor-specific
resource manager(s).

These assumptions are illustrated in the high-level architecture shown in Figure 2-15. For
systems that do not have a framework (that is, where user applications interface directly
with the IL), version 1.0 of the OpenMAX IL API specification does not specify how
resource management will be handled. Assumption 2 covers systems that have a single,
centralized resource manager as well.

![](img/2_15.png)

**Figure 2-15. Architectural Assumptions**
To ensure consistent component behavior in case of resource conflicts, a common
definition of component priority and a set of behavioral rules are needed.
####2.1.17.3  Component Priorities

Each IL component has a priority value (an OMX_U32 integer) that the IL client sets. 
The actual range of priorities can be left up to the platform, but the priority order is
important and needs to be the same across IL implementations. A descending order of
priority is chosen with 0 denoting the highest priority. The following tie-breaking rule
also applies: When comparing components with the same priority, components that have
acquired the resource most recently should be deemed to be of higher priority than
components that have had the resource longer.
####2.1.17.4  Behavioral Rules
The following behavior is defined on the IL layer:

-  The OMX_ErrorInsufficientResources error is called only on a component
that attempts to go to the idle state when there are insufficient resources and sufficient
resources cannot be freed by preempting lower priority components.
-  A component is not aware that preemption is occurring when it tries to go to the idle
state, and the resources it requires need to be freed by preempting lower priority
components.
-  When a component that already has resources needs to be preempted, it will send the
OMX_ErrorResourcesPreempted and OMX_ErrorResourcesLost errors
to the IL client as it moves from the Executing or Paused state to the Idle state and
from the Idle state to the Loaded state, respectively.
-  In cases where the IL client wants to know when the stream associated with the
component can be resumed or started, the IL client shall request to be notified when
resources are available. This occurs by putting the component into the
OMX_StateWaitForResources state. When the resources become available, the
component automatically goes to the idle state. When the client receives the
notification that the component is in the idle state, it can try to move the rest of the
components in that chain to the idle state as well. This automatic movement to the
idle state ensures that in cases where multiple IL clients are waiting for the same
resource, the IL client can resume or start the stream as soon as the resource is
available. If the component were to automatically move just to the loaded state, then
another IL client could grab that resource first.
These behavioral rules are intended to cover only the interactions between the IL client(s)
and the IL components.
####2.1.17.5  Hardware Vendor-Specific Resource Manager
To implement the behavioral rules, a hardware vendor-specific resource manager will
need to exist below the IL layer and perform the following functions:

-  Implement and manage the wait queue(s).
-  Keep track of available resources.
-  Keep track of each component that has resources and which resources they are using.
-  Notify a component or multiple components that they need to give up their resources
when a higher priority component requests the resource.
-  Notify the highest priority component waiting for a resource when the resource is
available.

The actual interactions between the components and the hardware vendor-specific
resource manager(s) are vendor-specific and outside the scope of this document. Section
3 provides more details of the parameter structures and use cases related to priority and
resource management.

#3 OpenMAX Integration Layer Control API
The OpenMAX Integration Layer API allows integration layer clients to control
multimedia components in the audio, video and image domains. An “other” domain is
also included to provide for extra functionality, such as audio-video (A/V)
synchronization. The user of the OpenMAX Integration Layer API is usually a
multimedia framework. In the rest of this document, the user of the OpenMAX
Integration Layer API will be referred to as the IL client.

The OpenMAX Integration Layer API is defined in a set of header files, namely:

-  OMX_Types.h: Data types used in the OpenMAX IL
-  OMX_Core.h: OpenMAX IL core API
-  OMX_Component.h: OpenMAX component API
-  OMX_Audio.h: OpenMAX audio domain data structures
-  OMX_IVCommon.h: OpenMAX structures common to image and video domains
-  OMX_Video.h: OpenMAX video domain data structures
-  OMX_Image.h: OpenMAX image domain data structures
-  OMX_Other.h: OpenMAX other domain data structures (includes A/V synchronization)
-  OMX_Index.h: Index of all OpenMAX-defined data structures
-  
This section describes how the OpenMAX core and OpenMAX components are
configured for operation.

First, the OpenMAX data types are introduced. Next, the methods of the OpenMAX core
are described. The methods that components implement are discussed in section 3.3.
Finally, section 3.4 shows calling sequences for a few meaningful operations, including
component initialization, normal data flow, data tunnel setup, and data flow in the
presence of data tunneling. Such sequence diagrams aim at describing the dynamic
interactions between the IL client, the IL core, and the OpenMAX components.

When documenting functions, the following convention is used for function parameters:

-  <param_name> [in] specifies an input parameter, which is set by the function caller
and read by the function implementation.
-  <param_name> [out] specifies an output parameter, which is set by the function
implementation and passed back to the caller. When the function returns, the caller
can read the new value of the parameter, which is passed as a reference.
-  <param_name> [inout] specifies an input/output parameter, which the function caller
can set. The function implementation can modify the parameter before returning it
back to the function caller.

This parameter classification can also be found in the OpenMAX header files, where the
null macros OMX_IN, OMX_OUT and OMX_INOUT are defined. OMX_IN corresponds to
the function parameter <param_name> [in]. OMX_OUT corresponds to the function parameter <param_name> [out], and OMX_INOUT corresponds to the function
parameter <param_name> [inout].
##3.1  OpenMAX Types
###3.1.1 Enumerations
Five 32-bit integer enumerations are defined in OMX_Core.h:

-  OMX_ERRORTYPE is returned by each function defined in the OpenMAX Integration
Layer API (see section 3.1.1.3).
-  OMX_COMMANDTYPE includes the possible commands that an IL client can send to
an OpenMAX component (see section 3.1.1.1).
-  OMX_EVENTTYPE includes events that can be generated inside an OpenMAX
component and that are passed to the IL client through a callback function (see
section 3.1.1.4).
-  OMX_BUFFERSUPPLIERTYPE includes all the possibilities for the buffer supplier
in the case of tunneled ports. A description of the use of this enumerative type can be
found in section 3.1.1.5.
-  OMX_STATETYPE, which is described in section 3.1.1.2.
Figure 3-1 shows the enumerations defined in OMX_Core.h.

![](img/3_1.png)


**Figure 3-1. Enumerations Defined in OMX_Core.h**
####3.1.1.1  OMX_COMMANDTYPE
Table 3-1 represents the possible commands that an IL client can send to an OpenMAX
component. Since commands are non-blocking, the OpenMAX component generates a
command completion event via a callback function when the command has completed.
Callbacks are defined in a dedicated structure; see section 3.1.2.7.

| Field Name | Description |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| OMX_CommandStateSet | Change the component state OMX_CommandFlush  Flush the queue(s) of buffers on a port of a component|
| OMX_CommandPortDisable | Disable a port on a component |
| OMX_CommandPortEnable | Enable a port on a component |
| OMX_CommandMarkBuffer | Mark a buffer and specify which other component will raise the event mark received|

Table 3-2 describes the parameters to be used for each command.

| Command code | nParam | pCmdData |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| OMX_CommandStateSet |OMX_STATETYPE – state to transition to | NULL |
| OMX_CommandFlush | OMX_U32 – target port ID | NULL |
| OMX_CommandPortDisable |OMX_U32 – target port ID | NULL |
| OMX_CommandPortEnable | OMX_U32 – target port ID | NULL |
| OMX_CommandMarkBuffer | OMX_U32 – target port ID |OMX_MARKTYPE* - mark data and target component |

**Table 3-2. Command Syntax**
####3.1.1.2  OMX_STATETYPE
Figure 3-2 illustrates the transitions among states that occur as a consequence of the IL
client calling OMX_SendCommand(OMX_StateSet, <state>), where the new state for
the component is passed as a parameter. A transition name surrounded by curly braces
indicates that the transition is not triggered by a command sent by the IL client but is a
consequence of internal component events

![](img/3_2.png)

**Figure 3-2. OpenMAX Component State Transitions**

This section describes component states. An IL client commands a component to change
states via the OMX_SendCommand function using the OMX_CommandStateSet
command.

Table 3-3 represents the states of an OpenMAX component.

| Field Name | Description | Resources Allocated |Location of buffer |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| OMX_StateInvalid | Component is corrupt or has encountered an error from which it cannot recover. | Unknown | Unknown |
| OMX_StateLoaded | Component has been loaded but has no resources allocated. | No | Not available |
| OMX_StateIdle | Component has all resources but has not transferred any buffers or begun processing data. | Yes | Supplier only |
| OMX_StateExecuting | Component is transferring buffers and is processing data (if data is available). | Yes | Supplier or non-supplier |
| OMX_StatePause | Component data processing has been paused but may be resumed from the point it was paused. | Yes |Supplier or non-supplier |
| OMX_StateWaitFor | Resources Component is waiting for aresource to become available.| No | Not available |

**Table 3-3. OpenMAX Component States**
######3.1.1.2.1  OMX_StateLoaded
A component is in the OMX_StateLoaded state after it has been created via an
OMX_GetHandle call and before allocation of its resources. In this state, the IL client
may modify the component’s parameters via OMX_SetParameter, set up data tunnels
on the component’s ports with OMX_SetupTunnel, or transition the component to
either the OMX_StateIdle state or the OMX_StateWaitForResources state.

The IL client may elect to transition a component that is currently in the
OMX_StateLoaded state into the OMX_StateWaitForResources state if, for example, the
component failed to acquire all of its resources on an attempted transition to the
OMX_StateIdle state.
###### 3.1.1.2.1.1  OMX_StateLoaded to OMX_StateIdle
If the IL client requests a state transition from OMX_StateLoaded to OMX_StateIdle, the
component must acquire all of its resources, including buffers, before completing the
transition. Furthermore, before the transition can complete, the buffer supplier, which is
always the IL client when not tunneling, must ensure that the non-supplier possesses all
of its buffers. For a port connected to the IL client, the IL client may allocate the buffers
itself and then pass them to the port via an OMX_UseBuffer call on the port, or it may
direct the port to perform the allocation via an OMX_AllocateBuffer call on the port.
When a port is tunneling, the supplier port either allocates buffers itself or, if the port
implements buffer sharing, re-uses buffers from a port on the same component. A
tunneling supplier port then passes the buffers to the non-supplier port via an
OMX_UseBuffer call on the non-supplier.

The number of buffers used on a port is specified in its port definition (see
OMX_IndexParamPortDefinition), which defaults to the minimum (specified in
the same structure) but which may be modified by the supplier before the sequence of
OMX_UseBuffer and OMX_AllocateBuffer calls via a call to
OMX_SetParameter.
#####3.1.1.2.2  OMX_StateIdle
In the OMX_StateIdle state, the component is ready to be used, meaning that all
necessary resources have been properly allocated. However, the suppliers retain all their
buffers, and no buffer exchange or processing is taking place. Thus, if this state is entered
from an OMX_StateExecuting or OMX_StatePause state, the component shall have
returned all buffers it was processing to their respective suppliers. The IL client may
transition the component to any states other than the OMX_StateInvalid and
OMX_StateWaitForResources states.
######3.1.1.2.2.1  OMX_StateIdle to OMX_StateLoaded
On a transition from OMX_StateIdle to OMX_StateLoaded, each buffer supplier must
call OMX_FreeBuffer on the non-supplier port for each buffer residing at the non-
supplier port. If the supplier allocated the buffer, it must free the buffer before calling
OMX_FreeBuffer. If the non-supplier port allocated the buffer, it must free the buffer
upon receipt of an OMX_FreeBuffer call. Furthermore, a non-supplier port must
always free the buffer header upon receipt of an OMX_FreeBuffer call. When all of
the buffers have been removed from the component, the state transition is complete; the
component communicates that the initiating OMX_SendCommand call has completed via
a callback event.
######3.1.1.2.2.2  OMX_StateIdle to OMX_StateExecuting
If the IL client requests a state transition from OMX_StateIdle to OMX_StateExecuting,
the component shall begin transferring and processing data. For ports that communicate
with the IL client, the IL client will initiate buffer transfers via
OMX_EmptyThisBuffer and OMX_FillThisBuffer. Among tunneling ports, any
input port that is also a supplier shall transfer its empty buffers to the tunneled output port
via OMX_FillThisBuffer.
#####3.1.1.2.3  OMX_StateExecuting
In this state, an OpenMAX component is transferring and processing data buffers. The
component shall accept calls to OMX_EmptyThisBuffer on its input ports and
OMX_FillThisBuffer on its output ports. Any port that communicates with the IL
client shall call the EmptyBufferDone and FillBufferDone callbacks to return an
empty or full buffer, respectively, back to the IL client. Any tunneling port shall call OMX_FillThisBuffer or OMX_EmptyThisBuffer on its corresponding tunneled
port to return an empty or full buffer, respectively, back to its tunneled port. An IL client
may transition a component in the OMX_StateExecuting state to either the
OMX_StateIdle state or the OMX_StatePaused state.
######3.1.1.2.3.1  OMX_StateExecuting to OMX_StateIdle
If the IL client requests a state transition from OMX_StateExecuting to OMX_StateIdle,
the component shall return all buffers to their respective suppliers and receive all buffers
belonging to its supplier ports before completing the transition. Any port communicating
with the IL client shall return any buffers it is holding via OMX_EmptyBufferDone
and OMX_FillBufferDone callbacks, which are used by input and output ports,
respectively. Any non-supplier port shall return all buffers it is holding to the input port
or output port it is tunneling with using OMX_EmptyThisBuffer or
OMX_FillThisBuffer, respectively. Likewise, any supplier tunneling port shall wait
for all of its buffers to be returned from its tunneled port.
#####3.1.1.2.4  OMX_StatePause
In this state, an OpenMAX component is not transferring or processing data but buffers
are not necessarily returned to their suppliers. From the OMX_StatePause state,
execution may be resumed via a transition to OMX_StateExecuting, preferably without
dropping data. The component may still accept data buffers at its input, but such buffers
will be queued only and not processed further. The IL client may transition a component
in the OMX_StatePause state to OMX_StateIdle or OMX_StateExecuting. On a
transition from OMX_StatePause to OMX_StateIdle, the component shall return all
buffers to their respective suppliers in a manner identical to the OMX_StateExecuting-to-
OMX_StateIdle transition described in section 3.1.1.2.3.1.
#####3.1.1.2.5  OMX_StateWaitForResources
In this state, the component is waiting for one or more of its required resources to become
available. This state is related to resource management. The assumption is that one or
more hardware-specific resource managers exist on the platform to handle available
resources. The interaction among OpenMAX components and resource managers is
outside the scope of this specification.

If a component in the OMX_StateLoaded state fails to enter the OMX_StateIdle state
because resources other than buffers are insufficient, the IL client may put the component
in the OMX_StateWaitForResources state if the IL client wants to be notified when the
needed resources become available. The IL client may command the component to
discontinue waiting for resources by transitioning it from the
OMX_StateWaitForResources state to the OMX_StateLoaded state. If a component in
the OMX_StateWaitForResources state acquires all the resources upon which it is
waiting, it shall initiate a transition to the OMX_StateIdle state.
######3.1.1.2.5.1  OMX_StateWaitForResources to OMX_StateIdle
When a component initiates a transition from the OMX_StateWaitForResources state to
the OMX_StateIdle state, it shall communicate the initiation of this transition to the IL
client via an OMX_EventResourcesAcquired event. When the IL client receives
the OMX_EventResourcesAcquired event, it shall call OMX_UseBuffer and
OMX_AllocateBuffer in the manner of a transition from OMX_StateLoaded to
OMX_StateIdle. Likewise, the component cannot complete its transition to
OMX_StateIdle until it acquires all of its resources, including buffers.
#####3.1.1.2.6  OMX_StateInvalid
In this state, the component has suffered internal corruption or an error from which it
cannot recover. When it detects such a condition, the component transitions itself to
OMX_StateInvalid and informs the IL client by generating an OMX_ErrorEvent event
with the value OMX_ErrorInvalidState. When the IL client receives OMX_EventError
indicating a transition to OMX_StateInvalid, it shall free all resources associated with
that component and eventually call OMX_FreeHandle to release the handle associated
with the component.

A component in the OMX_StateInvalid state shall fail every call made upon it and return
an OMX_ErrorStateInvalid error message except for OMX_GetState,
OMX_FreeBuffer, or OMX_ComponentDeinit. The IL client may also command a
transition to the OMX_StateInvalid state explicitly via OMX_SendCommand. A
component may transition between any state and the OMX_StateInvalid state.
####3.1.1.3  OMX_ERRORTYPE
The OMX_ERRORTYPE enumeration shown in Table 3-4 defines the standard
OpenMAX errors that all functions defined in the OpenMAX IL API return. These errors
should cover most of the common failure cases. However, vendors are free to add
additional error messages of their own as long as they follow these rules:

-  Vendor error messages shall be in the range of 0x90000000 to 0x9000FFFF.
-  Vendor error messages shall be defined in a header file provided with the component. No error messages are allowed that are not defined.

| Field Name | Value | Description |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| OMX_ErrorNone | 0 | The function returned successfully. |
| OMX_ErrorInsufficientResources | 0x80001000 |There were insufficient resources toperform the requested operation. |
| OMX_ErrorUndefined | 0x80001001 | There was an error but the cause of the error could not be determined. |
| OMX_ErrorInvalidComponentName |0x80001002 | The component name string wasinvalid. |
| OMX_ErrorComponentNotFound | 0x80001003 | No component with the specified name string was found. |
| OMX_ErrorInvalidComponent | 0x80001004 | The component specified did not have a OMX_ComponentInit entry point, or the component did not correctly complete the OMX_ComponentInit call. |
